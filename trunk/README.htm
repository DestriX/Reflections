	<p><b>What is RuneSource?</b><br />Hey there, thanks for checking out RuneSource. RuneSource is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open-source</a> server for the popular game <a href="http://runescape.com/">RuneScape</a>, written in the Java programming language. It is important to note that RuneSource is in no way endorsed or affiliated with RuneScape or its creator company, Jagex. Use of RuneSource is also against the RuneScape Terms of Service (which you may or may not be bound by). RuneSource is licensed via the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html">GNU General Public License Version 3</a>.</p>
	<p><b>Why was RuneSource made?</b><br />RuneSource was made by blakeman8192 for the general RuneScape emulation community, which is spread across many internet forums and IRC channels. The purpose of RuneSource is to provide a <u>stable</u>, <u>high-performance</u>, and <u>simple</u> RuneScape server emulator for people to use. At the current time of release (late 2010), all existing RuneScape server emulators are either very unstable and slow, or very complicated and hard to work with. RuneSource aims to solve these problems by being a stable and efficient server, and above all, by being simple and easy to use.</p>
	<p><b>Special Thanks</b><br />The author of RuneSource would like to personally thank the following individuals (in no specific order) for their countless contributions to RuneScape emulation, or just because they're awesome: <i>Graham, Taharok, Moparisthebest, super_, Stork, Miss Silabsoft, Sir Sean, samuraiblood2, Scar, Nour, Arkadian, Vastico, Method, PeeHPee, Peterbjornx, Boomer, DHAReauxK, Clienthax, Impulser, Zachera, Whitefang, Varek, Celkyborg, Palidino76, Xerozcheez, Galkon, Lmctruck, Purechaos, Gnarly, Ikiliki, Winten, wL, Daiki, and Wolf.</i> These people, among others, are members of the first generation of RuneScape hackers. Without these people, I believe that RuneScape private servers would not be anywhere near as developed as they are at the moment. My gratitude goes out to all of you guys. Thanks.</p>
